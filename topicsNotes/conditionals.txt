conditions can be provided using if elif and else statement

you have to use 'then' after every if and elif , just a syntax else it will give error and to give conditions inside if and elif double square brackets are used  and there should be space around square brackets otherwise compilation error will occur and the end of conditionals is marked with 'fi' at the end.

else if don't work in place of else if there is elif as in python

at the end of double square brackets if you put semi-colon then it will not give an error as in javascript

e.g.

if [[ $var == "10" ]]
then
	echo "var is 10"
elif [[ $var == "20" ]];
then
	echo "var is 20"
else
	echo "var is unknown"
fi

if [[$var == "10"]] // it will give error as there are not spaces around the double square brackets

if[[ $val == "10" ]]; // it will also give error for the same reason

once refer last section of loops.txt for conditional operators

to check if directory or file exists or not

if [[ -d <directory name> ]]  // if folder exists
if [[ ! -d <directory name> ]]  // if folder not exists

if [[ -f <file name> ]]  // if file exists
if [[ ! -f <file name> ]]  // if file not exists
