if you want to schedule a script or a command then you can you either use 'at' command or crontab

at command is used to schedule a script for only one time after the script is executed for one time it will be removed from the scheduled job list

atq : to view the scheduled jobs list
atrm <id> : to remove the job with the specified id from the scheduled list

syntax of at :

at 12:09 PM  and in the same way you can provide date month year time
	./script.sh or bash script.sh or you can give any command
ctrl + d

the date and time is provided in the same format as date and time is printed by using date command

crontab : if you want to schedule a task which repeat itself after a period of time then you can use crontab

crontab -l : to check existing jobs
crontab -e : to add a new job , or remove or edit a job
             basically it opens a crontab editor just like vim and there you
             can provide scripts for scheduing

syntax :

* * * * * <path to the directory of the script> && <name of the script file>

these five stars are used to give day of week (0-6), month (1-12), day of month (1-31), hour (0-23), minute (0-59) starting from right star to left

means first star is used to give minute and last star is used to give day of the week

e.g.   30 18 * * SUN : it means that it will repeat itself on every sunday at
                       18:30
