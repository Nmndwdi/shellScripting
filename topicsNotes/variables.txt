# : it is used to make single line comments

multiline comments can be made by :

<< <comment block name> // to start the comment
actual comment ...
........
<comment block name> // to end the comment

variables are created just like in python
and values of variables is retrieved by placing a dollar sign before a variable name in the echo command

values of a command can be retrieved in echo by placing a dollar sign before a command and you should give the command in paranthesis else the command would be treated as a variable

values of ordinary variables can be changed

constant variables are those whose values can't be changed once initialized,
they are created by placing the keyword readonly before the variable name,
you can't take input from the user in readonly variables
