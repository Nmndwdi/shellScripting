condition1 && condition2 || condition3

if condition1 is true then condition 2 is executed else 3 will be executed

just like condition ? true : false

? -> &&
: -> ||

in place of condition2 and condition3 any command can also be given

conditions are executed in [[ condition ]] in double square brackets with space around double square brackets else there will be error
