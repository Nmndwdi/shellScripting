there is no try catch concept in shell scripting for error handling instead we can use some techniques for efficiently handle error , and we use if conditionals for handling errors

Use set -e at the beginning of your script to make it exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.

Use set -x at the beginning of your script to debug your script line by line

After running a command, you can check its exit status using the $? variable. If it's non-zero, an error occurred.

Encapsulate code within functions and use return codes to indicate success or failure

every command and function returns its exit status as 0 on success
so by checking exit status one can do efficient error handling or one can explicitly use return codes to indicates success or failure in functions

you can exit the script immediately by using 'exit 1' command in case if any error occurs
