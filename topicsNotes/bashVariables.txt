bash variables are the predefined variables provided by the shell which can be used directly like

RANDOM variable -> used to generate a random number between 0 and 32767
UID variable -> used to get the user ID of the logged in user
USER variable -> used to get the current user

* user id of root user is 0
if you want your script should be only run by root user then you can check the user id of the logged in user and if it is 0 then you can run the script else you can exit the script by using exit 1
