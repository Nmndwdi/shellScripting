it is not a map but an array of key-value pairs

it is declared by using declare keyword and -A flag like :

declare -A mapname // it is just the declaration

and values can be added just like in array like :

mapname+=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 [key3]=value3 ...)

and the values can be access just like array but giving keyname instead of index

like : ${mapname[key]}
