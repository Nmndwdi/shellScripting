in this there is no switch keyword instead there is case keyword

e.g.      case $choice in  // choice is variable

then we can give case by providing case value with closing paranthesis

e.g.      a)                  like case a : 
	  "sum")              like case "sum" : 
	  10)                 like case 10 : in other languages

;; is used to end the case otherwise it will give error

*) it is default case if none matches then it will be executed

and at last esac is used to end the case statement just like in if
in if there is fi reverse of if and here is esac reverse of case
