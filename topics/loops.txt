in shell scripting the available loops are for loop, while loop and until loop, do-while is not available in shell scripting

for loop syntax :

for (( i=0;i<5;i++ ))
do
	commands
done

while loops syntax :

j=0 // initialization

while [[ $j -lt 5 ]]  // while condition is true
do
	commands
done

these for and while loops are for performing 5 iterations

a=10
until [[ $a -eq 1 ]]  // until condition is false i.e until a will not become
do                    // 1 this loop will get executed
	commands
done

until loop is just opposite of while loop

in for loop we can you conditional operators like < , <= , > , >= , !=
while for checking conditions as in while loop and until loop these will not work instead we use

conditionals :

for Integer Comparison
-eq : for equal to
-ne : for not equal to
-gt : for greater than
-ge : for greater than or equal to
-lt : for less than
-le : for less than or equal to
< : for less than               // below it do not work in while loop conditions
> : for greater than
<= : for less than or equal to
>= : for greater than or equal to

for String Comparison
= : for equal to
== : for equal to
!= : for not equal to
< : for less than
> : for greater than
-z : for string is null
