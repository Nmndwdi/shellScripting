you directly cannot do the arithmetic operation else they will be treated as concatenation instead of arithmetic operation

you can do it by using let keyword before variable name or by using double paranthesis
e.g.

x=10
y=2

mul=$x*$y  // does concatenation

let mul=$x*$y // does multiplication operation by using let keyword before variable name

add=$(($x+$y))  // by using double paranthesis

you can perform arithmetic operations like addition + , multiplication * , subtraction - , division / , modulus % and exponentiation by using **

division is floor division it does not give decimal value

an operation is performed in double paranthesis (( operation ))
