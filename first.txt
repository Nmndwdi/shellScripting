the shell scripting file should be saved with extension .sh

first line of the script should be shebang, The shebang line is crucial because it ensures that your script is executed with the correct interpreter, regardless of the current shell of the user. Without the shebang line, the script might not work as intended if the user's default shell is not bash.(used to tell the interpreter on which shell it has to execute the file e.g. bash, csh, fish, ksh, etc) e.g. of shebang line : #!/bin/bash

# : it is used to give a single line comment in shell script

you have to give the executable permission to the .sh file to get executed

to execute the file you have to give the path to the file starting with '.'
./ is the path to the current directory
e.g. ./first.sh
